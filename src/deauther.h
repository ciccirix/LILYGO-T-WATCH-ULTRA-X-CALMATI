// Dedicated 802.11 deauthentication transmitter. Targets a single AP by BSSID +
// channel and floods broadcast deauth/disassoc frames at its clients from a
// background task. Intended for testing the resilience of networks you own or
// are authorised to assess.
//
// On IDF 5.x the SDK rejects injected management frames unless the weak symbol
// ieee80211_raw_frame_sanity_check() is overridden — deauther.cpp does that.

// Begin flooding `bssid` on `channel`. Puts WiFi into STA+promiscuous, fixes the
// channel, and spawns the TX task. Returns false if already running.
bool deauther_start(const uint8_t bssid[6], uint8_t channel);

// Knock ONE station off its AP: deauth targeted at a single client MAC (addr1),
// spoofed from `bssid`. Kicks e.g. an IP camera off WiFi without disrupting the
// rest of the network. Same radio takeover as deauther_start.
bool deauther_start_client(const uint8_t client[6], const uint8_t bssid[6], uint8_t channel);

// Stop the flood and return the radio to its pre-attack state.
